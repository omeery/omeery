### 🔍 About Me

I am a passionate **Application Security Engineer** with a focus on enhancing software security through secure coding practices, automated vulnerability scanning, and AI-driven solutions. With a solid background in full-stack development, I bridge the gap between development and security by incorporating robust security measures early in the software lifecycle. My mission is to create **tools that empower developers** to write secure code, find vulnerabilities early, and improve overall application security.

Currently, I am focused on improving security in the **DevSecOps** pipeline and exploring **AI-powered static analysis tools** for web applications.
